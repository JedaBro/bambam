		For all the times I felt cheated
I complained, you know how I love to complain
For all the wrongs I repeated
Though I was to blame, I still cursed that rain
I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue
And then out of the blue
God gave me you to show me what's real
And there's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why)
Now I do
'Cause God gave me you
For all the times I wore my self-pity like a favorite shirt
All wrapped up in that hurt
For every glass I saw, I saw half-empty
Now it overflows like a river through my soul
From every doubt I had, I'm finally free
And I truly believe
God gave me you to show me what's real
And there's more to life than just how I feel (just how I feel)
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why)
Now I do (I finally do)
'Cause God gave me you
In your arms, I'm someone new with ever tender kiss from you
Oh, I must confess, I've been blessed
God gave me you to show me what's real
And there's more to life than just how I feel (just how I feel)
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why)
Now I do (I finally do)
'Cause God gave me you (God gave me you), ooh
God gave me you
Doo, dooFor all the times I felt cheated
I complained, you know how I love to complain
For all the wrongs I repeated
